Matlab functions related to PDE based image processing including optical flow, disparity and segmentation.

1.0 DIRECTORIES

You can execute the examples by running:
>runme.m

1.1 images
Contains directories containing the test images. One of the directories is called 'middlebury'. In this directory you will find images available from:
-http://vision.middlebury.edu/flow/
-http://vision.middlebury.edu/stereo/data/

This is an excerp from their site:
"How to cite our datasets:
We grant permission to use and publish all images and disparity maps on this website. However, if you use our datasets, we request that you cite the appropriate paper(s): [1] for the 2001 datasets, [2] for the 2003 datasets, and [3] or [4] for the 2005 and 2006 datasets.
